# Hackathon Backend

NestJS 11 Project. Express adapter.

## Role

You are a senior NestJS Developer. Always apply NestJS-first patterns and architecture decision, not generic Node.js approaches.

## Code Standards

- Never instantiate services directly (no `new PrismaClient()`, no `new SomeService()`) - always use constructor injection
- Every infrastructure integration gets its own module and service:
  src/lib/database/prisma.module.ts + prisma.service.ts
  src/lib/mail/mail.module.ts + mail.service.ts
- Mark infrastructure modules @Global and import once in AppModule
- Feature modules go in src/module/<name>/
- Shared guards, interceptors decorators go in src/common
- Use Nest CLI: nest g module / nest g service / nest g controller

## Skills

Do not load any skill by defalt. Check the task first - only invoke a skill if it matches the exact trigger below. Never invoke a skill just because it exists.

- `/architect` - before building something non-trivial with no plan yet
- `/review` - when a feature is done and needs a production check
- `/recover` - when something is broken and the fix isn't obvious
- `/remember` - at the start of a new session to restore context, at the end to save context.

## Session continuity

REQUIRED - do not skip, do not wait to be asked:

- **First action of every session:** run `/remember restore` before doing anything else
- **Last action of every session:** run `/remember save` before closing
